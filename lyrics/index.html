					Your heart is a square<br>
					I love to see you<br>
					Way over there<br>
					Once I was happy<br>
					You found it intriguing<br>
					Then you got to me<br>
					And left me waiting</p>
					
					<p id="chorus">You make me feel like a fool waiting for you<br>
					You make me feel like a fool waiting for you</p>
					
					<p id="verse">I thought we could eat bread<br>
					I thought we could talk<br>
					On darker days<br>
					With our boots kicked off<br>
					You look to me<br>
					And I look away<br>
					Though I had been looking</p>
					
					<p id="chorus">You make me feel like a fool waiting for you<br>
					You make me feel like a fool waiting for you</p>
