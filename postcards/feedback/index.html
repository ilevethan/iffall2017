		<h1>Discussion Points/Topics for Mimi from Isabella</h1>
		<li>
		The design aesthetic is striking and playful, and the images complement the quotes
		<li>
		The three postcards go well as a set and have a visual thread throughout them
		<li>
		The visual priority of the postcards is the image of the cookie monster, with the text and background being secondary
		<li>
		The text and images shift vertically, which will work well in responsive design
		<li>
		The only image that is hard to read is the phone image #2, where text is not legible
		<li>
		I suggest you add a solid color or remove some of the imagery so that we can more clearly read it
		<li>
		The image resolution is clear
		<li>
		Remember to use webfonts so that you can code it without a problem
