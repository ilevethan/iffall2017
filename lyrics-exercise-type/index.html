		<span class="verse-1">
		<p>Your name is a triangle <br>
		Your heart is a square <br>
		I love to see you <br>
		Way over there <br>
		Once I was happy <br>
		You found it intriguing <br>
		Then you got to me <br>
		And left me waiting</span> <br></p>

		<span class="chorus"><p>You make me feel like a fool waiting for you <br>
		You make me feel like a fool waiting for you<br></p></span>

		<p>I thought we could eat bread<br>
		I thought we could talk<br>
		On darker days<br>
		With our boots kicked off<br>
		You look to me<br>
		And I look away<br>
		Though I had been looking<br></p>

		<span class="chorus"><p>You make me feel like a fool waiting for you<br>
		You make me feel like a fool waiting for you<br></p></span>
