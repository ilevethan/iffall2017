				<h1>History</h1>
				<p>The practice of drinking tea has a long history in China, having originated there. Although tea originated in China, during the Tang Dynasty, Chinese tea generally represents tea leaves which have been processed using methods inherited from ancient China. According to popular legend, tea was discovered by Chinese Emperor Shen Nong in 2737 BCE when a leaf from a nearby shrub fell into water the emperor was boiling. Tea is deeply woven into the history and culture of China. <br><br>

				Chinese tea can be classified into five distinctive categories: white, green, oolong, black and post-fermented. Some researchers have counted more than 700 of these beverages. However, the largest factor in the wide variations comes from differences in tea processing after the tea leaves are haarvested. White and green teas are heat-treated soon after picking to prevent oxidization, often called fermentation, caused by natural enzymes in the leaves. Oolong teas are partially oxidized. Black teas are fully oxidized. Other differences come from variations in the processing steps.</p>
