				<span class="verse">Your name is a triangle<br>
				Your heart is a square<br>
				I love to see you<br>
				Way over there<br>
				Once I was happy<br>
				You found it intriguing<br>
				Then you got to me<br>
				And left me waiting<br>
				<br>
				<span class="chorus">You make me feel like a fool waiting for you<br>
				You make me feel like a fool waiting for you</span><br>
				<br>
				I thought we could eat bread<br>
				I thought we could talk<br>
				On darker days<br>
				With our boots kicked off<br>
				You look to me<br>
				And I look away<br>
				Though I had been looking<br>
				<br>
				<span class="chorus">You make me feel like a fool waiting for you<br>
				You make me feel like a fool waiting for you</span><br>
